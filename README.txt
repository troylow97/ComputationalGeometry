Description
===========
CGEngine - Computation Geometry Engine
    - The purpose of this application is to simulate algorithms that 
      relates to computational Geometry.
    - This application is multi-threaded, which allows the application
      to render the vertices and edges simultaneously while running
      the algorithm, exhibiting Real-Time Interactive Simulation.
